# üìù Testing container-to-host network connectivity in WCOW BuildKit builds

## ‚öôÔ∏è Test setup:

Dockerfile:

```aiignore
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022
RUN curl.exe http://<hostmachineIP>:1234
```

(Example using host machine IP `172.20.176.1`)

Build environment:

buildkitd running on the host, listening on 172.20.176.1:1234.
`start-Process buildkitd -ArgumentList "--addr tcp://172.20.176.1:1234 --debug"`

running  `buildctl`

```aiignore
buildctl build `
  --frontend=dockerfile.v0 `
  --local context="E:\dockerfiles\demo-a\test-network\" `
  --local dockerfile="E:\dockerfiles\demo-a\test-network\" `
  --output type=image,name=docker.io/100909/testnetwork:latest,push=false
```

## üß™ Test results [buildctl build ...]:

```aiignore
[2/2] RUN curl.exe http://172.20.176.1:1234:
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 172.20.176.1 port 1234 after 3 ms: Could not connect to server
error: failed to solve: process "cmd /S /C curl.exe http://172.20.176.1:1234" did not complete successfully: exit code: 7

```

## Observations:
‚ùå The build container was unable to connect to the host machine's IP (172.20.176.1) on port 1234.

‚úÖ Verified that `buildkitd` was actively listening on `172.20.176.1:1234` from the host itself.

‚ùå Despite correct IP and port, no connection from inside the build container was possible.

## üîé Root cause analysis:
BuildKit's build containers are network-isolated from the host during builds, especially on Windows.

Windows BuildKit builds often run in a NAT network or even Hyper-V isolation(unverified), preventing direct access to host machine IPs.

There is no `--network=host` support during builds on Windows, unlike Linux, which limits network configuration options.

Therefore, a build step attempting to connect back to the host machine (even via its own IP) is blocked or unreachable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key insight:
On Windows, build steps (including RUN commands and custom frontends running during the build) cannot reliably reach the host machine's network services, including the same `buildkitd` instance that runs the build.


## üö´ Impact:

Frontends or build steps that need to call back to the host machine over the network will fail under normal Windows BuildKit configurations.

Techniques that work on Linux (like using host.docker.internal or --network=host) do not apply reliably on Windows.

## ‚úÖ Possible next steps:

Explore experimental network workarounds.
